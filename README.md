# Book Management/Library App - Jetpack Compose Version

This project contains a mobile aggregation application specifically for managing read books. It allows adding book entries to its database, opening them in a separate menu and modifying their entries in the application display. The application has a Material user interface, and it is written in Kotlin, using Jetpack Compose.

In this iteration of the project, the data is saved locally, in the device's memory, and all of the expected CRUD operations are implemented.
